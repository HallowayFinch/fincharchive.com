**Recovered notes from incomplete transmissions.**  
This archive collects first‑person logs and field notes by Halloway Finch. Each entry is presented as a documentary fragment—credible enough to question, incomplete enough to haunt.

For canonical releases, see the Substack publication at **hallowayfinch.com**.  
For provenance, each entry is mirrored here with metadata and stable URLs.
