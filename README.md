# Finch Archive

Recovered notes from incomplete transmissions.

This repository is the canonical archive for **Halloway Finch**.  
It hosts public logs, recovered media artifacts, and integrity data that together form the public record at **fincharchive.com**.

## Structure
```
/logs/         ‚Üí individual recovered logs (one file per log)
/artifacts/    ‚Üí supporting media & metadata (audio, images, hashes)
index.md       ‚Üí site home
.nojekyll      ‚Üí disable Jekyll so raw files serve unchanged
```

---

## How to Browse
- **Logs:** see `/logs/` (e.g., `log-1022a.md`)  
- **Artifacts:** see `/artifacts/` with per-log folders (e.g., `/artifacts/log-1022a/`)  
- **Integrity:** each artifact folder includes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` for verification  

---

## Conventions
- **Log file names:** `log-<id>.md` (e.g., `log-1022a.md`)  
- **Timestamps:** 24-hour format `HH:MM:SS.mmm` when relevant  
- **Artifact naming:** concise kebab-case (e.g., `you-heard-it_rev_10m22s.mp3`)  
- **Checksum algorithm:** SHA-256 recorded in `SHA256SUMS.txt`  
- **Metadata:** Each artifact folder includes a `metadata.json` for machine-readable context  

---

## Integrity and Verification
To verify an artifact‚Äôs integrity:

```bash
cd artifacts/log-1022a
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

A ‚Äú‚úì OK‚Äù result confirms the file matches the official archive hash.
