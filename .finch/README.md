# .finch

Internal reference material for the Finch Archive project.

This folder is **not for publication**. It exists to keep the Halloway Finch canon consistent across:
- Logs (`_logs/`)
- Field Notes (`_field-notes/`)
- Artifacts (`artifacts/`)
- Automation metadata and “RecoveryDaemon” behaviors

## How to use this folder

- If you’re writing a new Log: start with `reference/voice-style-guide.md`, then the appropriate template in `reference/templates/`.
- If you’re adding a new “truth” to the universe: update `reference/canon-ledger.md`.
- If you’re introducing a new location: add it to `reference/sites-and-recoveries.md`.
- If you’re adding a recurring term: add it to `reference/lexicon.md`.
- If you’re planning puzzle-layer elements: use `reference/puzzle-layer.md`, but keep puzzle logic **subordinate** to story integrity.

## Guardrail

Everything here supports the primary goal:

**Publish believable documentary fragments that feel recovered, incomplete, and quietly alarming.**
