# .finch
*Internal reference folder (public repo)*

This folder contains the **production references** for the Finch Archive project: canon guardrails, voice/style calibration, formatting specs, continuity tracking, and planning notes.

Although these documents are labeled “internal,” this repository is public. Treat the contents as **canon-adjacent** and avoid placing sensitive spoilers here unless you want readers to potentially interpret them as lore.

## How to use this folder

### When writing a new Log
1. Read: `.finch/reference/voice-style-guide.md`
2. Confirm format: `.finch/reference/format-spec.md`
3. Use a template: `.finch/reference/templates/`
4. Preflight: `.finch/reference/continuity-checklist.md`

### After publishing (or importing) a new Log
- Add any new “truth” to: `.finch/reference/canon-ledger.md`
- Add any new recurring term to: `.finch/reference/lexicon.md`
- Add any new location to:
  - `.finch/reference/sites-and-recoveries.md` (index)
  - `.finch/reference/locations-dossier.md` (deep sheet, if needed)
- If it creates or resolves a contradiction:
  - Track it in `.finch/reference/timeline.md`
  - Record the decision in `.finch/reference/continuity-log.md`

### When planning long-term escalation
- Use: `.finch/planning/arc-map.md`
- Keep spoilers general unless you want them discoverable.
