# Continuity Log & Retcon Register
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This is the canon changelog.
Use it whenever you standardize terminology, revise constraints, or decide a contradiction is intentional.

**Rule:** If you think “I’ll remember that,” you won’t. Log it.

## Entries

| Date (CT) | Change | Why | Affected Material | Public Impact | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----|------------------|--------------|------|
| 2026-01-16 | Split/expanded internal docs into eight “production” references; removed legacy codex | Maintainability + clarity | `.finch/reference/*` | None | Codex retired in favor of structured docs. |
| 2026-01-16 | Defined certainty tags for timeline | Prevent accidental contradictions | `timeline.md` | None | Supports intentional DISPUTED entries later. |
| 2026-01-16 | Locked Archive/Daemon constraints (no plain speaking, no exposition) | Preserve tone + realism | `characters-and-entities.md` | None | Escalate only late, if ever. |

## How to Use

Add an entry when you:
- Rename a term (“Signal Memory” → something else)
- Change a structural rule (word count, footer marker)
- Introduce a new site signature
- Decide a conflict is intentional (DISPUTED) vs corrected
