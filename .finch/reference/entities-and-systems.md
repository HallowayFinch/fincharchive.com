# Entities & Systems
*Internal reference — not for publication*

## Halloway Finch
Role: narrator / observer / compiler (depending on record)  
Presentation: professional, restrained, document-first

## The Archive
Role: publishing apparatus that may be fallible or autonomous  
Behavior options (use sparingly):
- misattribution
- conflicting provenance notes
- appended timestamps that don’t align

## RecoveryDaemon
Role: in-world label for automated compilation  
Can appear as:
- an HTML comment
- a footer line
- a “compiled at” stamp
Keep it subtle; never turn it into a speaking character too early.

## Oversight (implied)
References to:
- “annex”
- “decommission”
- “funding cycle”
- “access badge”
- “procedure memo”
Never name the agency cleanly unless you want that to become canon.
