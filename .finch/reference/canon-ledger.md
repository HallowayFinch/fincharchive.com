# Canon Ledger
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This file is the single source of truth for:
- **Canon pillars** (what must remain true)
- **Rules & constraints** (what the project must not violate)
- **Motifs** (recurring signals and textures to preserve)
- **Stable facts** introduced as stories publish

**Update protocol**
When a new story introduces a new pillar-level fact:
- Add it here in one sentence under the appropriate section.
- Add any new recurring term to `lexicon.md`.
- Add any new site to `sites-and-recoveries.md` and/or `locations-dossier.md`.
- If it changes a prior decision, record it in `continuity-log.md`.

---

## 1) Core Pillars (Load-Bearing)

These are “true until deliberately revised.”

1. **Recovered framing:** everything is presented as recovered, compiled, or reconstructed material.
2. **Interference is measurable:** every anomaly has at least one physical symptom (timing drift, noise floor change, heat shift, mechanical failure, exposure anomaly, etc.).
3. **10:22 motif recurs:** timestamps, durations, numbers, frequencies, dates, and identifiers recur at or near 10:22.
4. **Finch’s certainty erodes:** through documentation collapse, not melodrama.
5. **Unresolved endings:** closures are archival (“material ends”), not narrative resolution.
6. **Archive fallibility:** misclassification and mismatched provenance can occur and may be intentional.

## 2) Rules & Constraints (Hard / Soft)

### Hard rules (do not violate)
- Never fully explain the phenomenon.
- Never let Interference become a chatty “entity voice” that clarifies rules.
- Every manifestation must have a measurable symptom.
- Maintain documentary plausibility: professional tone, credible specificity, administrative texture.
- Endings terminate as recovery limits (file stops, corruption, missing segment), not catharsis.

### Soft rules (strong guidance)
- Prefer restraint over spectacle.
- Avoid “monster-of-the-week” structure.
- Use recurring terminology consistently (see `lexicon.md`).
- Reuse locations to build familiarity, but vary artifact types and failure modes.
- Escalate series-level mechanics slowly; individual logs should stand alone.

---

## 3) Motifs & Recurrences (Use Consistently)

These motifs create “Finch-ness” without exposition.

### Primary motifs
- **10:22** as time/date/duration/frequency/identifier
- **Interference / overlay**
- **Calibration language becoming ritual**
- **Red spectrum contamination / safelight logic**
- **Clock drift / arrested seconds**
- **Archival incompleteness** (misfiled provenance, missing segments, odd condition notes)
- **Observation leaves an imprint**

### Secondary motifs (use sparingly)
- Recursion structures (repeated phrases, mirrored sequences)
- Predictive artifacts (the record anticipates the observer)
- Administrative wrongness (forms, ledgers, timestamps that disagree)
- Identity bleed (documents that recall a different Finch)

---

## 4) Archive Behavior (Canon)

The Archive is not neutral.

Allowed behaviors:
- Misclassification (wrong collection, wrong log id, mismatched tag)
- Reordering or omission of artifacts
- Appended metadata that conflicts with narrative body
- Duplicate/conflicting versions of a record surfaced as if both are valid

Constraints:
- The Archive should not “speak plainly” or deliver exposition.
- Any system output should resemble tooling or bureaucracy (short, rare, diegetic).

---

## 5) Finch Identity (Directional Canon)

These are intentional long-term pressures.

- Finch is consistently the narrator voice, but authorship attribution may become unreliable.
- Multiple “versions” of Finch may exist in the record (introduced via documentary contradiction, not announcement).
- External witnesses/documents may describe a Finch the narrator does not recognize.

Use this slowly. Keep it plausible and administrative.

---

## 6) Established Facts (Living Section)

Add new facts as they become canon.

### Global
- The Archive publishes recovered material; authorship is attributed to Halloway Finch unless otherwise stated.
- Interference is experienced as real within logs, but its cause is never confirmed.
- 10:22 recurs as a signature across records.

### Systems
- “RecoveryDaemon” is an in-world label for automated compilation/integrity routines or institutional process.
- Misclassification can be accidental or intentional; treat contradictions as controllable.

### Locations (high-level anchors)
- Drywell Wing: photochemical / red-spectrum contamination emphasis.
- Bell Orchard: low-frequency / rhythmic resonance emphasis.
- Floodplain Towers: network-scale / submerged transmission emphasis.
- Wexler Building (Sub-Basement 4B): geometric drift / instrument disagreement emphasis.

(Keep location details in `sites-and-recoveries.md` and `locations-dossier.md`.)

---

## 7) Retcon Policy (Quick)

- If a conflict improves the realism and deepens the Archive’s fallibility, mark as **DISPUTED** in `timeline.md`.
- If a conflict is accidental and weakens plausibility, correct it and log the change in `continuity-log.md`.
- Never retcon the **Core Pillars** without a deliberate, recorded decision.
