# Canon Ledger
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This is the running list of “true until revised” facts.

## Global
- The Archive publishes recovered material; authorship is attributed to Halloway Finch unless otherwise stated.
- Interference is real as an experienced phenomenon within the logs, but its cause is never confirmed.
- 10:22 recurs across records as time/date/duration/frequency/identifier.

## Archive behavior
- The Archive may misclassify, misattribute, or attach artifacts incorrectly.
- “RecoveryDaemon” is a plausible system process that compiles and timestamps material.

## Finch identity (directional canon)
- Multiple “versions” of Finch may exist in the record.
- External documents may describe a Finch the narrator does not recognize.

## Update protocol
When a new story introduces a new pillar-level fact:
- Add it here in one sentence.
- Add any new term to `lexicon.md`.
- Add any new site to `sites-and-recoveries.md`.
