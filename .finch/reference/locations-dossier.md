# Locations Dossier
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This dossier expands the index in `sites-and-recoveries.md` into repeatable, consistent “site sheets.”
Use it to keep sensory anchors and failure modes consistent across multiple logs.

## A) Site Sheet Template

**Site Name:**  
**Type:** (facility / rural / submerged / residential / unknown)  
**Sensory Anchors:** (3–7 bullets: smell, light, temperature, acoustics)  
**Typical Recoveries:** (media types + common filenames if helpful)  
**Common Failure Mode:** (noise floor drift / red contamination / clock arrest / mechanical stall / exposure shift)  
**Narrative Function:** (what fear flavor this site delivers)  
**Do Not Overuse:** (how to keep it fresh)  
**Cross-Links:** (related sites, Procedure 22 relevance, artifacts)

## B) Known Sites (Working Sheets)

### 1) Drywell Wing
**Type:** abandoned research sub-basement  
**Sensory Anchors:**
- wet concrete and mineral damp
- fixer residue / metallic tang
- narrow fluorescent buzz
- footsteps feel “recorded” (repeat-like acoustics)
**Typical Recoveries:** negatives, prints, CCTV frames, lab logs  
**Common Failure Mode:** red-spectrum contamination; exposure anomalies  
**Narrative Function:** photochemical dread; “images that update themselves”  
**Do Not Overuse:** avoid repeating the “approaching figure” beat; vary artifact type  
**Cross-Links:** Signal Memory; archival misclassification opportunities

### 2) Bell Orchard
**Type:** rural test plot / degraded agricultural infrastructure  
**Sensory Anchors:**
- silt and iron-rich soil smell
- rusted irrigation towers and dry joints
- low-frequency hum that reads like “pressure” more than sound
**Typical Recoveries:** audio reels, soil telemetry, sensor dumps  
**Common Failure Mode:** rhythmic resonance; “heartbeat” patterning  
**Narrative Function:** organic-mechanical fusion; earth as transmitter  
**Do Not Overuse:** keep “the thing in the ground” ambiguous; focus on measurement drift  
**Cross-Links:** Procedure 22 (later); Floodplain network potential

### 3) Floodplain Towers
**Type:** submerged/partially submerged signal pylons  
**Sensory Anchors:**
- ballast hum implied even when silent
- pressure distortion / ear-pain descriptions
- waterline stains and mineral crust
**Typical Recoveries:** frequency maps, diver notes, radio fragments  
**Common Failure Mode:** low-frequency interference; timing drift under pressure  
**Narrative Function:** scale escalation; networked anomaly  
**Do Not Overuse:** don’t turn it into action-horror; keep it observational  
**Cross-Links:** Archive autonomy arc; cross-media artifact opportunities

### 4) Wexler Building — Sub-Basement 4B
**Type:** decommissioned research annex / structural audit zone  
**Sensory Anchors:**
- air that tastes “old,” stagnant, electrically dry
- corrosion, stress, and geometry as the primary language
- quiet that amplifies measurement sounds
**Typical Recoveries:** inspection camera footage, structural notes, corrosion photos  
**Common Failure Mode:** angle deviation / geometric drift; instruments disagree  
**Narrative Function:** precision dissolves; the building “corrects” observation  
**Do Not Overuse:** avoid making geometry magical; keep it mechanical and documented  
**Cross-Links:** good place for multi-Finch contradictions via conflicting audits

## C) Location Discipline

- Reuse sites to create familiarity, but rotate the **artifact type** and **failure mode emphasis**.
- Each site should feel like it has a “signature,” but never a fully explained rule set.
- Keep at least one detail stable across all appearances (a smell, a sound, a light quality).
