# Characters, Entities & Systems
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This is the constraint layer: it prevents voice drift, canon drift, and “power creep.”
It defines what Finch is, what the Archive is allowed to do, and how systemic weirdness should appear without breaking realism.

## 1) Halloway Finch (Baseline)

**Role:** Observer / recorder / compiler (varies by attribution).  
**Default register:** procedural, precise, emotionally restrained.  
**Primary drive:** understanding through documentation; control through measurement.

### What does not change (protect these)
- Writes like a professional under constraints.
- Leads with time, equipment, environment, and procedure.
- Avoids explaining the phenomenon outright.
- Dread appears indirectly through omissions, corrections, and degraded certainty.
- Does not “perform” fear; the record reveals it.

### What can change (allowed variability)
- Confidence in measurement (erodes under repeated anomaly).
- Memory continuity (gaps, misordered sequences).
- Trust in the Archive’s labeling and provenance.
- Increasing suspicion that observation is reciprocal.

### Typical behaviors (signature moves)
- Rechecks and calibration.
- Administrative detail (sign-outs, service dates, access protocols).
- Corrections (“I re-read…”, “I replaced…”, “I verified…”).
- Stops short of narrative closure; ends at recovery limit.

## 2) Finch Variants (Long-Term Direction)

Variants should feel like **documentation collisions**, not “multiverse lore.”

### Variant tells (choose 1–2 per variant; keep subtle)
- Different header habits (extra metadata line, missing field, alternate “Condition” vocabulary).
- Different measurement emphasis (audio/noise floor vs structural tolerances vs photochemical exposure).
- Different moral posture (more cautious, more compulsive, more resigned).
- Different relationship to the Archive (trusting vs adversarial vs unaware).

**Rule:** Variants are never introduced as variants in-text.  
They are inferred from contradictory documentation.

**Constraint:** No “variant reveal scene.” Let the *paperwork* reveal it.

## 3) The Archive (Systemic Presence)

**Role:** repository / publishing apparatus; may be fallible or autonomous.

### What the Archive can do (allowed)
- Misclassify documents (wrong collection, wrong log id).
- Attach, reorder, or omit artifacts.
- Append metadata that conflicts with the narrative body.
- Surface duplicate or conflicting versions of a record.
- Introduce administrative “wrongness” (timestamps that don’t align, provenance notes that contradict).

### What the Archive must not do (until very late, if ever)
- Speak plainly in a “character voice.”
- Provide clean exposition or “answers.”
- Act like a sentient villain with goals stated to the reader.

**Preferred expression:** administrative weirdness, not personality.

---

## 4) RecoveryDaemon (In-World Mechanism)

**Role:** label for automated compilation, integrity routines, or institutional process.

### Allowed appearances
- Short compilation stamps.
- Rare system-output blocks (brief, tool-like).
- Metadata anomalies that look machine-produced.
- “Integrity language” (hashes, checksums, rebuild notes) that stays diegetic.

### Forbidden appearances
- Long dialogues.
- Emotional language.
- “I am evil / I want…” statements.

**Rule of plausibility:** if it appears, it should resemble tooling or bureaucracy.

---

## 5) Oversight (Implied Institutions)

Keep oversight legible but unnamed:
- annexes, decommission memos, audit cycles
- badge access, sign-out ledgers, service records
- “procedure” language that reads like policy

**Guardrail:** do not lock a real-world agency name into canon unless you want that to become permanent.

---

## 6) “Entity” behavior constraints (Interference)

The phenomenon is referred to as **Interference** (see `lexicon.md`).

### What Interference *is allowed to be*
- A measurable overlay (signal, image, pattern, timing drift).
- A response-like behavior that can be recorded indirectly.
- Something that “fits” the observer (breath rhythm, cadence, repetition) without declaring intent.

### What Interference must not become
- A chatty monster.
- A rule-explainer.
- A power that can do anything at any time.
- A deus ex machina that resolves the plot.

**Canon rule:** every manifestation must have at least one measurable symptom (temp shift, noise floor change, mechanical stall, exposure drift, clock arrest, etc.).

---

## 7) How to show dread without breaking realism

Use:
- compulsive re-measurement and calibration
- “administrative” contradictions (forms, timestamps, conflicting provenance)
- controlled omission (“I won’t describe…”, “I did not return…”)
- corrections and errata as tension

Avoid:
- direct emotional narration (“I was terrified”)
- lore dumps
- big cinematic confrontation beats

## 8) Public-repo note (spoiler boundary)

This repo is public. These references may be read as lore by determined readers.
Keep deeper future arc specifics *general* and move spoiler-heavy planning to `.finch/planning/` when needed.
