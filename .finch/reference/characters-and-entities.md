# Character & Entity Sheets
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This is the constraint layer: it prevents voice drift and “power creep.”

## 1) Halloway Finch (Baseline)

**Role:** Observer / recorder / compiler (varies by document attribution).  
**Default register:** procedural, precise, emotionally restrained.  
**Primary drive:** understanding through documentation; control through measurement.

### What does not change (protect these)
- Writes like a professional under constraints.
- Leads with time, equipment, environment, and procedure.
- Avoids explaining the phenomenon outright.
- Dread appears indirectly through omissions, corrections, and degraded certainty.
- Does not “perform” fear; the record reveals it.

### What can change (allowed variability)
- Confidence in measurement (erodes under repeated anomaly).
- Memory continuity (gaps, misordered sequences).
- Trust in the Archive’s labeling and provenance.
- Increasing suspicion that observation is reciprocal.

### Typical behaviors
- Rechecks and calibration.
- Administrative detail (sign-outs, service dates, access protocols).
- Corrections (“I re-read…”, “I replaced…”, “I verified…”).
- Stops short of narrative closure; ends at recovery limit.

## 2) Finch Variants (Long-Term Direction)

Variants should feel like **documentation collisions**, not “multiverse lore.”

### Variant tells (choose 1–2 per variant; keep subtle)
- Different header habits (extra metadata line, missing field, alternate “Condition” vocabulary).
- Different measurement emphasis (audio/noise floor vs structural tolerances vs photochemical exposure).
- Different moral posture (more cautious, more compulsive, more resigned).
- Different relationship to the Archive (trusting vs adversarial vs unaware).

**Rule:** Variants are never introduced as variants in-text.  
They are inferred from contradictory documentation.

## 3) The Archive (Systemic Presence)

**Role:** repository / publishing apparatus; may be fallible or autonomous.

### What the Archive can do
- Misclassify documents (wrong collection, wrong log id).
- Attach or reorder artifacts.
- Append metadata that conflicts with the narrative body.
- Surface duplicate or conflicting versions of a record.

### What the Archive must not do (until very late, if ever)
- Speak plainly in a “character voice.”
- Provide clean exposition or “answers.”
- Act like a sentient villain with goals stated to the reader.

**Preferred expression:** administrative weirdness, not personality.

---

## 4) RecoveryDaemon (In-World Mechanism)

**Role:** label for automated compilation, integrity routines, or institutional process.

### Allowed appearances
- Short compilation stamps.
- Rare system-output blocks.
- Metadata anomalies that look machine-produced.

### Forbidden appearances
- Long dialogues.
- Emotional language.
- “I am evil / I want…” statements.

**Rule of plausibility:** If it appears, it should resemble tooling.

---

## 5) Oversight (Implied Institutions)

Keep oversight legible but unnamed.
- Annexes, decommission memos, “audit periods,” sign-out ledgers.
- The reader can sense institutional weight without a named agency.

**Guardrail:** Do not lock a real agency name into canon unless you want to inherit its baggage.
