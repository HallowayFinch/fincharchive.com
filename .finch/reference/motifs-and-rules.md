# Motifs & Rules
*Internal reference — not for publication*

## Motifs
- 10:22 (time/date/count/frequency)
- Interference / overlay
- Calibration language becoming ritual
- Red spectrum contamination / safelight logic
- Clock drift / arrested seconds
- Archival incompleteness and misfiled provenance
- “Observation leaves an imprint”

## Rules (hard)
- Never fully explain the phenomenon.
- Every anomaly must have at least one measurable symptom.
- The record must remain plausible as a document produced by a professional.
- Endings terminate as *recovery limits*, not narrative resolution.

## Rules (soft)
- Keep recurring terms consistent (see lexicon).
- Reuse a small set of locations and expand them slowly.
- Escalate puzzle-layer elements only when they feel like natural archival metadata.
