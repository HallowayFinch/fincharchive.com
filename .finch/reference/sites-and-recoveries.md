# Sites & Recoveries
*Internal reference — not for publication*

Each site entry should include:
- sensory signature
- what kind of recoveries come from there
- what failure mode is typical (noise, heat, exposure shift, drift)

| Site | Atmosphere | Recovered material | Notes |
|------|------------|-------------------|------|
| Drywell Wing | wet concrete, fixer residue, metal stair resonance | negatives, prints, CCTV frames | good for red-spectrum contamination |
| Bell Orchard | silt, rusted irrigation towers, low-frequency hum | audio, soil telemetry, reels | good for “heartbeat” patterns |
| Floodplain Towers | submerged pylons, ballast hum, pressure distortion | radio fragments, frequency maps | good for network-scale escalation |
