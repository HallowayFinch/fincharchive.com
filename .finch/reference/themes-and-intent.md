# Themes & Intent
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This page is the “why.”
It keeps Finch from drifting into vibes that dilute the project.

## Core thesis (working)

The horror is not the entity.
The horror is the document proving that observation leaves an imprint—and the imprint looks back.

---

## Primary themes

- **Observation as contamination**  
  Looking is not neutral. Measurement changes the measured.

- **Identity instability**  
  The record cannot guarantee a single Finch. The Archive may be merging lives.

- **Institutional rot / procedural dread**  
  Bureaucracy persists after meaning collapses. Protocol becomes ritual.

- **Memory vs evidence**  
  When instruments disagree, the record becomes a negotiation with reality.

- **Unfinished transmission**  
  Endings do not resolve. They terminate.

---

## Emotional targets

- Quiet dread (not adrenaline)
- Credible realism (specificity as a weapon)
- Gradual loss of certainty
- A sense of “administrative wrongness”
- Aftertaste: the reader feels complicit for having looked

---

## Anti-goals (what Finch should not become)

- Monster-of-the-week
- Action-horror setpieces
- Villain monologues
- “Lore dumps” explaining the rules
- A clean mythology with named factions and tidy answers
- Excessive gore as the primary scare device

---

## North-star rules (short)

- **The document is the horror.**
- **The record is incomplete by nature.**
- **The Archive may be wrong on purpose.**
- **The anomaly must leave measurable symptoms.**
- **If you can explain it cleanly, remove the explanation.**
