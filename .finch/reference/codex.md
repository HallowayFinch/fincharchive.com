# The Finch Archive Codex  
*Internal reference document — compiled by H. Finch / unknown archivist*  
*(Not for publication)*  

---

## I. Origin / Mandate  
Purpose of the Archive:  
- To collect, preserve, and interpret anomalous transmissions, images, and recovered media.  
- Operating assumption: every interference event contains an imprint of observation.  
- The archive’s authority or funding source is uncertain — records imply both academic and military oversight between 1952–1974.  
- Motto or procedural creed (optional): “Observe without interruption.”  

Open questions:  
- Was Finch the founder, the last survivor, or the archivist who found someone else’s work?  
- Does the Archive predate its own records?

## II. Field Sites  
Catalog of known or suspected recovery locations.  
Each entry should include atmosphere, sensory signature, and type of material recovered.

| Site | Description | Recovered Material | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------------------|-------|
| **Drywell Wing** | Abandoned research sub-basement beneath unknown facility. Smell of fixer and wet concrete. | 35mm negatives / darkroom prints | First confirmed log (1022B). |
| **Bell Orchard** | Former agricultural test plot; trees replaced with rusted irrigation towers. | Audio reels / soil telemetry data | Connected to “The Orchard Transmission.” |
| **Floodplain Towers** | Six signal pylons half-submerged after the 1963 dam collapse. | Radio frequencies at 50Hz; interference consistent with ballast hum. | Possibly site of Procedure 22 tests. |
| _(Add more as stories evolve)_ | | | |

## III. Media Types  
All recovered artifacts fall into one or more of the following categories:

- **Analog Audio:** tape, reel, wax cylinder, vinyl, or field recording.  
- **Photographic:** glass plates, negatives, film stills, Polaroids, CCTV frames.  
- **Written / Printed:** field notebooks, partial transcripts, log fragments.  
- **Digital / Corrupted:** binary data, failed AI training outputs, memory dumps.  
- **Physical Artifacts:** objects imprinted or altered by exposure to signal (lamps, wires, paper, tissue).  

Each medium has its own failure mode (noise floor, exposure shift, checksum corruption, etc.) that can become part of story texture.

---

## IV. Temporal & Signal Anomalies  
Patterns observed across multiple logs:  
- **10:22 Motif:** timestamps, exposure durations, or frequency markers recurring at or near 10:22.  
- **Clock Arrests:** second hands halting slightly past the mark.  
- **Red Light Phenomenon:** visual contamination resembling safelight hue or blood filtration.  
- **Echo Phrases:** “Procedure complete,” “Field test,” “Finch conducting,” recurring across decades.  
- **Reverse Correlation:** recordings that predict or anticipate future observations.  

Rules:  
- Never explain anomalies outright.  
- Every manifestation must have a measurable, physical symptom (temperature shift, static, mechanical failure).

## V. Lexicon  
Shared vocabulary of the Archive. Keep consistent usage across stories.

| Term | Meaning / Tone | First Use |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Interference** | Any unexplained overlay of signal or image; both phenomenon and verb (“to interfere”). | Core mythos |
| **Procedure 22** | Recurrent protocol involving controlled observation; exact parameters unknown. | Planned future log |
| **Signal Memory** | Hypothesis: materials retain information through light or vibration. | The Lamplight Study |
| **Red Memory** | Subtype of contamination linked to visible red spectra; possibly biological. | TBD |
| **Recovery Daemon** | System that compiles and timestamps logs; may act autonomously. | (Meta concept) |

## VI. Personnel  
| Name / Designation | Role | Status | Notes |
|--------------------|------|--------|-------|
| **Halloway Finch** | Archivist / Observer | Uncertain | Voice of logs. Analytical, detached. Possibly multiple individuals using same name. |
| **A. Mirek** | Mentioned in draft notes; may have preceded Finch. | Missing | Precursor researcher. |
| **Recovery Daemon / System** | Automated archival protocol. | Active? | Adds metadata to recovered files without human review. |
| _(Add future recovered personnel or correspondents)_ | | | |

---

## VII. Structural Rules  
1. Every log opens with metadata (`Log #### — Title`, Recovered date, Condition).  
2. Section breaks (`---`) mark temporal or perceptual shifts.  
3. Voice remains first-person procedural unless clearly noted as transcript or interview.  
4. Tone: analytical → unraveling → unresolved.  
5. End always includes `[End of recovered material]`.  
6. Only direct transmissions or calibration phrases may use `>` indentation.  
7. Word length target: 950–1,100 words.

## VIII. Puzzle Layer Index  
*(Draft concept for “Cicada Detroit”-style artifacts)*  

**Level 1 — Visible Layer**  
- Subtle alphanumeric codes in metadata.  
- Photographs containing visual Morse or steganographic patterns.  

**Level 2 — Archive Layer**  
- Binary sequences hidden in story HTML comments or GitHub commits.  
- Dates corresponding to other log release times.  

**Level 3 — Cross-Media Layer**  
- Physical postcards, sound spectrograms, or filenames leading to coordinates.  
- Each clue should feel like part of the recovery process, never “fan bait.”  

**Design principle:** the solution should *add understanding*, not “unlock rewards.”  
Players become researchers, not codebreakers.

## IX. Tone Map  
Gradual progression of horror intensity across the Archive.

| Phase | Emotional Register | Example / Goal |
|-------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Observation** | Cold realism; procedural tone; unease through absence. | *The Voice in the Static* |
| **Interference** | The anomaly reacts; physical symptoms appear. | *The Lamplight Study* |
| **Contamination** | The medium or observer begins to transform. | Upcoming stories |
| **Recursion** | Archive references itself; Finch becomes subject. | Long-term arc |
| **Collapse** | The Archive fails to contain the phenomenon. | Final phase |

## X. Development Notes  
- Weekly or biweekly releases, 10:22 PM schedule.  
- Each story exists as a self-contained document but implies continuity.  
- Future expansion: Field Notes, recovered letters, artifact photographs, interactive waveform pages.  
- Visual consistency: serif titles, monospace body, muted red accent.
