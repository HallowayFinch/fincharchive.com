# Puzzle Layer
*Internal reference — not for publication*

The puzzle architecture is an **artifact-based discovery system**, not a “game.”
Everything must appear to serve archival or integrity purposes.

## Tier 1 — Surface Layer
Text/visual embedded.
- header hashes
- acrostics
- subtle repetition structures
- image-channel variation (rare)

## Tier 2 — Archive Layer
Infrastructure metadata.
- HTML comments
- RSS GUID patterns
- commit/automation artifacts that look incidental

## Tier 3 — Cross-Media
Artifacts drive discovery.
- spectrogram reveals
- scans with embedded data
- cross-log cipher keys

### Guardrails
- no password walls
- no out-of-world instructions
- puzzle outcomes must deepen mythos, not distract from story
- tier escalation should be slow and optional for readers
