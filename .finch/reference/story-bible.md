# Halloway Finch Story Bible
*Internal reference — not for publication*

**Primary tagline:** Recovered notes from incomplete transmissions.  
**Archive stance:** The site is a *repository*, not a blog. Everything is “recovered,” “compiled,” or “reconstructed.”

---

## 1) Core premise

The Finch Archive collects and publishes documentary fragments: logs, transcripts, field notes, and recovered media that appear to originate from (or be compiled by) **Halloway Finch**.

The material suggests a recurring phenomenon the Archive calls **Interference** — an intrusion of signal, image, or pattern that behaves as though it is **aware of observation**.

The reader is never told what to believe.
- Events may be real, misinterpreted, fabricated, or caused by breakdown.
- The Archive itself may be acting without human authorization.
- Records imply oversight (academic, military, private) but never confirm it cleanly.

## 2) What makes Finch “Finch”

### The voice
Finch writes like a careful professional:
- procedural, observational, calibrated
- precise language and measurement
- emotionally restrained
- fear appears indirectly (through omission, repetition, corrections, and degraded certainty)

### The promise
Finch does not “perform horror.”
He records. He catalogs. He tries to understand.  
The horror comes from what the record accidentally reveals.

## 3) The Archive as a character

The Archive is not neutral.
It organizes, timestamps, titles, and sometimes **misclassifies**.

Over time, the Archive may:
- attribute documents to Finch that Finch did not write
- attach artifacts to the wrong log (or insist they belong)
- surface contradictory “versions” of Finch as if they are the same person

This should remain plausible and diegetic: an archival failure that might also be an intentional behavior.

## 4) Canon pillars

These are the “load-bearing” truths to protect.

1. **Recovered framing:** everything is presented as recovered material.  
2. **Interference is measurable:** every anomaly has at least one physical symptom (heat, noise floor shift, mechanical failure, light contamination, timing drift, etc.).  
3. **The 10:22 motif recurs:** timestamps, durations, numbers, frequencies, dates — sometimes subtle, sometimes blunt.  
4. **Finch’s certainty erodes:** not via melodrama, but via documentation collapse.  
5. **Unresolved endings:** closures are archival (“material ends”), not narrative (“problem solved”).

---

## 5) The multi-Finch instability (long-term direction)

A core escalation path for the universe:

- Witnesses, documents, or systems occasionally recall a **different Finch** than the narrator.
- The Archive may merge records from multiple Finches, treating them as one identity.
- Contradictions should feel like administrative reality (misfiled documents, conflicting bios, different signatures) rather than fantasy exposition.
- The reader should wonder: is Finch splitting, being replaced, or being *compiled*?

This is a slow-burn tool. Use sparingly, but consistently.

## 6) Allowed content shapes

- **Log (primary):** 950–1,100 words. Procedural entry → unraveling → archival termination.
- **Field Note (support):** ~250–450 words. Narrow scope, technical emphasis, “after-action” fragments.
- **Recovered transcript:** must include provenance (source medium, condition).
- **Artifact-led entry:** the media drives the story; text remains interpretive, not theatrical.

---

## 7) Tone guardrails

Aim for:
- quiet dread
- credible specificity
- restraint

Avoid:
- big villain monologues
- “the entity said…”
- dream logic without measurement
- gore as a primary scare device
- explaining the rules of the universe directly

---

## 8) Structural requirements (format)

- Starts with a metadata header (log id, title, recovery date, condition, source).
- Opens with procedural detail (time, equipment, environment).
- Uses section breaks (`---`) to mark shifts.
- Ends with an archival marker: **`[End of recovered material]`**
- Any “system voice” (daemon output, calibration strings) must be visually distinct and rare.

---

## 9) Escalation model (phased)

Phase 1: **Observation**  
Phase 2: **Interference**  
Phase 3: **Contamination**  
Phase 4: **Recursion / identity bleed**  
Phase 5: **Archive autonomy**

Escalation should be legible only in hindsight.
Each story stands alone; the pattern emerges across many.
