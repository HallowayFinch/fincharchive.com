# Voice Reference Packet
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This packet is a quick calibration tool.
It should contain short “gold standard” excerpts that define Finch’s voice.

Because published logs may evolve, this file is structured as a **living collection**.

---

## A) Gold Standard Excerpts (paste from published Logs)

Paste 3–7 short excerpts here (50–120 words each).
Each excerpt should demonstrate one signature element.

### Excerpt 1 — Procedural opening
**Source:** Log ____ — “_____”  
**Why it’s gold:** establishes tone with time/equipment/environment  
> [PASTE HERE]

### Excerpt 2 — Measurement under strain
**Source:** Log ____ — “_____”  
**Why it’s gold:** rechecks, calibration, instruments disagree  
> [PASTE HERE]

### Excerpt 3 — Dread via omission
**Source:** Log ____ — “_____”  
**Why it’s gold:** fear implied; not announced  
> [PASTE HERE]

### Excerpt 4 — Archival termination
**Source:** Log ____ — “_____”  
**Why it’s gold:** ends at recovery limit; unresolved  
> [PASTE HERE]

## B) “Do This / Not This” (micro-patterns)

### Do this
- “I rechecked the timestamp against the device clock.”
- “The audio floor rose by a measurable amount and stayed there.”
- “The print showed change where no new exposure occurred.”

### Not this
- “I was terrified and knew something evil was here.”
- “The entity told me the rules.”
- “It was all a dream, but also totally real.”

## C) Signature Moves Checklist

- Time stamp early; time drift later.
- Equipment specificity (model/condition/service history).
- Administrative realism (sign-outs, access, decommission notes).
- Anomaly expressed as a **symptom**, not a lore explanation.
- Corrections/errata as tension.
- Ending terminates as record failure, not plot wrap-up.

## D) Optional: Fresh “Calibration Samples” (original, internal)

These are NOT from published logs. They exist only to test voice.

**Sample 1 (procedural register):**  
I began the intake at 09:14. The unit was serviceable, though the housing showed abrasion along the left edge consistent with prior drops. The lens was clean. The air in the stairwell carried a damp metallic odor I initially attributed to standing water. The first anomaly was not visual. It was temporal.

**Sample 2 (controlled unraveling):**  
I repeated the measurement three times, then replaced the tape. The result stayed within tolerance until I looked away from the dial. When I returned my eyes to it, the needle had advanced past the mark by a degree that should have required force I did not apply.
