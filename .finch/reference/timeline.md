# Timeline & Chronology Map
*Internal reference — not for publication*

This document tracks chronology in two lanes:

- **Publication Order** (what readers receive)
- **Recovery Order** (what the Archive claims)

Use **certainty tags** to keep contradictions intentional:

- **CONFIRMED** — explicitly stated in-text or metadata
- **INFERRED** — strongly implied; consistent with canon pillars
- **DISPUTED** — conflicts exist (may be intentional)
- **UNKNOWN** — not established yet

## A) Publication Order (Reader-Facing)

| Pub # | Log ID | Title | Canonical Date (UTC) | Recovery Site | Certainty | Notes |
|------:|--------|-------|----------------------|--------------|----------|------|
| 01 | 1022A | The Voice in the Static | TBD | TBD | UNKNOWN | Establishes baseline tone + 10:22 motif. |
| 02 | 1022B | The Lamplight Study | TBD | Drywell Wing | INFERRED | Introduces red-spectrum contamination + “Signal Memory.” |
| 03 | 1022H | The Angle Deviation Study | 2025-11-22T04:22:36+00:00 | Wexler Building (Sub-Basement 4B) | CONFIRMED | Structural/measurement framing; good “audit log” reference. |
| … | … | … | … | … | … | Add entries as logs publish. |

## B) Recovery Order (In-World Sequence)

Recovery order is how the Archive claims the material was acquired/compiled.
This may differ from publication order.

| Seq # | Source Medium | Recovery Date | Condition | Attribution | Certainty | Notes |
|------:|--------------|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|------|
| 01 | TBD | TBD | TBD | H. Finch | UNKNOWN | First compiled batch (placeholder). |
| 02 | TBD | TBD | TBD | H. Finch / Archive | UNKNOWN | Use DISPUTED if misattribution is deliberate. |

---

## C) Anchor Events & “Fixed Points”

These are canon pillars that can be referenced without pinning full chronology:

- **10:22 motif** recurs across records (time/date/duration/frequency/identifier).
- **Interference is measurable** (at least one physical symptom per incident).
- **Archive fallibility** (misclassification / mismatched provenance) is possible and sometimes intentional.

Add “fixed points” only when they become truly load-bearing.

## D) Contradictions Register (Intentional vs Accidental)

When a conflict appears, log it here immediately.

| ID | Conflict | First Seen | Affected Logs | Status | Resolution Plan |
|----|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| C-001 | Example: two recovery dates for same artifact | TBD | TBD | OPEN | Decide: intentional (DISPUTED) or correct metadata. |

---

## E) How to Use This During Writing

Before finalizing a new Log:
1. Add it to **Publication Order**.
2. If it introduces provenance details, update **Recovery Order**.
3. If it creates a conflict, record it in **Contradictions Register**.
4. If it adds a new “fixed point,” confirm it belongs in **Anchor Events**.
