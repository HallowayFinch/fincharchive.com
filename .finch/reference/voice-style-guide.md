# Voice & Style Guide
*Internal reference — not for publication*

## Finch’s default register

Write like:
- a careful investigator
- a lab tech with good prose discipline
- a field auditor documenting risk

### Sentence shape
- short to medium sentences
- minimal metaphor
- sensory detail used as evidence, not poetry

### What Finch notices first
- time
- equipment
- environmental conditions
- procedural intent (“why I was there”)
- failure modes (noise, drift, corrosion, heat, smell)

## “Clinical → unraveling” progression

Start:
- calm, measured, confident

Middle:
- anomalies accumulate, Finch becomes corrective (“I rechecked…”, “I replaced…”, “I verified…”)

End:
- the document degrades (missing time, repeated lines, broken sequences, interrupted recording)
- Finch does **not** deliver catharsis — the record simply stops

## Show dread via:
- compulsive re-measurement
- minor contradictions
- sudden avoidance (“I did not go back into…”, “I won’t describe…”, “I can’t account for…”)
- procedural language becoming ritualistic

## Avoid:
- direct emotional narration (“I was terrified”)
- explanation dumps
- “ancient evil” framing
- generic creepypasta phrasing

## Specificity checklist (include 4–7 per Log)
- exact time(s)
- model numbers or plausible equipment descriptors
- distances / dimensions
- temperatures or sensory proxies
- material conditions (rust, film grain, noise floor, humidity)
- administrative language (sign-out logs, access badges, annex names)

## Ending patterns that work
- abrupt corruption
- last line repeats earlier calibration
- the artifact contradicts the text
- the Archive appends a mismatched timestamp
- the final sentence is cut mid-measurement

## Formatting standards
- Section breaks with `---`
- If you use an indented “system output,” keep it short and rare.
- Keep the 10:22 motif present somewhere (time, count, frequency, ID, etc.).
