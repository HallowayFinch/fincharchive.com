# Finch Archive · Build & deploy the Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
#
# Triggers:
# - On push to `main` when site-relevant files change (content, layouts, assets, config)
# - Manual run via "Run workflow" (workflow_dispatch)
#
# Notes:
# - Uses the official GitHub Pages Jekyll build action.
# - Concurrency ensures only the latest run is active to avoid redundant builds.
