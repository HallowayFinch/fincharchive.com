I arrived at the Marrow Creek reservoir a little after nine.  

Fog clung to the surface, thick enough to dull the light.  

Somewhere beneath that still water lay the old agricultural station — WMC-22 — shut down after the flood in the late seventies.

My task was simple: confirm whether any of the original soil telemetry beacons still emitted a signal.

They had been designed to broadcast low-band pulses, measuring moisture across the orchard rows that once stood here. The trees had long rotted away.

Only the towers remained — six rusted spires half-sunk into the bank, panels coated in algae.

When I powered one on, the air changed.  

The frequency was supposed to be below the threshold of hearing, yet I felt it in my chest — a steady vibration, about fifty hertz, the same pitch the archive lights make when their ballast begins to fail.

I spoke a calibration phrase into the recorder:  

> “Field test. Soil telemetry. Finch conducting.”

The transmitter pulsed once. A clean waveform. No interference.  

Procedure complete. Or at least, it should have been.

---

By early afternoon, the data looked wrong.

A second waveform overlapped my test signal — faint, but rhythmic, like something repeating a few miles away.  

When I filtered the noise, I heard a woman’s voice threaded through the carrier wave:

> “…county weather, reporting clear skies…”

The recording ended in static.  

A perfect ten-second fade.

The last documented broadcast from WMC-22 had been the day before the flood.

I told myself it was an atmospheric reflection — an old transmission refracting off the water.  

But when I replayed the file, the inflection had changed — the same words, newly spoken.

I checked the beacon.  

Its indicator light was pulsing again, though I hadn’t scheduled a second test.

---

By dusk, interference had spread to nearby bands.  

Even my vehicle radio — long dead from disuse — buzzed faintly with the same voice, half-submerged in static.  

When I switched it off, the speaker kept vibrating, a breath against the air.

I shut down power to the array.  

The sound persisted — not from the equipment, but from the ground itself.

A low hum rising through the soil, like something stirring beneath the surface.

I scraped a bit of earth near the transmitter’s base. The dirt was warm and smelled faintly sweet, like fruit beginning to rot.  

When I touched it, the hum grew louder.

I recorded another note:  

> “Residual feedback loop. Possible piezoelectric discharge. Continue observation until nightfall.”

---

An hour later, the beacon reactivated.  

I hadn’t restored power.

The broadcast was clearer this time — the voice older, slower:

> “…county weather, orchard… winds south…”

Then static.  

A rhythm pulsing underneath, almost like breathing.

The indicator light blinked in time with it, reflecting across the reservoir in soft green flashes.  

For a moment I thought I saw shapes beneath the water — rows of trees shifting as though a current moved through them.

The hum deepened.  

Every instrument needle on my console drifted upward in unison — soil saturation, barometric pressure, electrical potential.  

All rising together.

---

I keyed the mic.  

> “Station WMC-22, this is Finch. Conducting manual override. Please confirm transmission.”

There was a pause, then my own voice came back — flat, filtered, repeating the same words.

But when I compared the timestamps, the echo had spoken first.

I shut everything down again.  

Still, the voice lingered in the speaker, fading only when I stepped away from the array.  

The moment I turned back, it returned.

---

Around nine, condensation began forming on the transmitter’s casing.  

Not water — something thicker, amber-colored, smelling faintly of apples.  

It hissed when it touched metal.

The ground trembled once — not enough to register as seismic, more like breath expanding under the soil.

I packed the recorder, sealed the logs, and prepared to leave.  

Before disconnecting the final cable, I noticed the transmitter display flicker to life.

A single line scrolled across the screen:  

> WMC-22 — LIVE  

Then my own voice:  

> “Cut the signal. You already started it.”

---

The drive back took less than an hour.  

Halfway along the access road, the dashboard radio turned on by itself.  

The same weather report played through the static — distant but clear.  

In the background, beneath the voice, came a faint sound: leaves moving in slow rhythm, though there was no wind.

I parked at the archive just before eleven.  

Even with the ignition off, the radio kept transmitting, low and steady.  

The antenna glowed faintly green.

I logged the event as uncontrolled field emission, sealed the equipment, and placed it in Cold Room 3 alongside previous Marrow Creek artifacts.  

Temperature stable. Signal quiet.

I should have left it there.

But the hum followed me up the stairwell.

By the time I reached my office, I could hear it through the vents — a pulse just below hearing, patient, familiar.  

I thought of the orchard then.  

The rows beneath the water.  

And the voice that spoke before I did.

I turned on the recorder again, meaning to document the phenomenon.

Instead, I heard breathing on the line.  

Not mine.

> “…weather’s changing…”

I left it running.

When I came back hours later, the reels were still turning — though the power light was off.  

The hum hadn’t stopped.  

It had just learned to wait.
