The package was on my doorstep at 06:14. No postage. No return label. The cardboard smelled faintly of mildew, the kind that settles in unventilated basements or attics that haven’t been opened in years.

Inside was a single object:

a cassette tape labeled in block handwriting:

FINCH — SLEEP SESSION (8 HRS)

SOURCE A-3

The handwriting did not match anyone in the Archive.

I do not own a cassette recorder, but an equipment locker three floors beneath the Archive holds an old digitizer. I brought the tape in and began a transfer.

The hiss of degraded magnetic tape filled the room.

An uneven thrum beneath it.

A faint, slow breathing layered into the noise floor.

Not mine.

Not anybody else’s.

A third category.

---

The recording began at 00:00:00 with steady breathing. Slow. Asleep.

The acoustics were wrong for my home. Too much reverberation. A narrow space. Low ceiling. Possibly a basement room with unfinished walls.

I increased the gain by six decibels.

The breathing became unmistakably recognizable.

Same cadence as mine.

Same faint whistle from an old fracture in the nasal cartilage.

It was me.

Eight hours of me sleeping in a room I have never entered.

I marked the anomaly at 00:17:14.

A soft shuffle near the microphone. Not fabric. Not the movement of a sleeper. Something repositioning itself in the room.

A second breath, very faint, exhaled close enough to fog a mic capsule.

Then a whisper:

“He’s coming.”

Not my voice.

Not entirely.

---

At 01:04:22, a low static swell appeared. A pattern, not random. A slow rising and falling that matched the sleeper’s breath but offset by half a cycle, as if echoing it from a different position.

Occasionally the two rhythms aligned.

During those intervals, the static thinned to a tone.

The spectrogram displayed a harmonic that did not correspond to any known electrical artifact.

I isolated the frequency.

It resembled the vowel shape of a human voice filtered through interference.

A phrase emerged faintly:

“…leave before he wakes.”

No pronoun clarification.

No indication of who “he” referred to.

My breath on the tape remained slow and regular.

---

At 02:39:51, something sat down on the mattress.

Not metaphorically.

The microphone caught a shift in weight:

springs compressing,

the soft groan of a frame taking load,

fabric tightening beneath downward pressure.

The sleeper did not stir.

The second breath was closer now.

Directly beside the sleeping form.

Listening.

I adjusted the left channel EQ.

A faint murmur surfaced, impossible to parse at first.

Then it clarified:

“…you shouldn’t see this part.”

The whisper used my mouth shape.

My consonants.

A perfect imitation of fatigue.

But the timbre was slightly off-frequency, as though recorded through a tube.

---

At 03:14:10, the tape caught a change in the sleeper’s position: a shift of limbs, an arm sliding against fabric.

A soft throat sound.

Not fully waking — rising toward consciousness.

Breath catching.

Another voice whispered:

“Not yet.”

And the sleeping version of me obeyed.

His breath returned to its slower pattern.

I made a note: external influence on autonomic response? unseen presence?

The mattress creaked again, subtly, under the distribution of new weight.

Whoever — whatever — had joined him… remained.

---

At 04:58:40, I noted the first instance of overlap speech.

The sleeper spoke in a whisper. A brief phrase:

“Don’t close the door.”

Except no door sound preceded it.

Two seconds later, the other voice said:

“He already did.”

Tone neutral.

Intimacy in the delivery.

As if the two voices shared the same lungs.

I replayed the segment multiple times.

There was no splice.

No edit.

No second take.

Just two versions of my voice offset in time, one anticipating a condition the other did not yet perceive.

---

At 05:22:17, the audio gained a rhythmic pulse.

Thump.

Pause.

Thump.

Not the heart.

Not machinery.

More like knuckles lightly tapping the wall behind the sleeper.

Testing.

Searching.

The sleeper murmured again.

A second, involuntary syllable: “mm—no—”

The other voice hushed him:

“Don’t wake him.”

But the pronouns felt disordered.

Was the sleeper not the person being referred to?

Which “him” was the warning meant for?

The air in the recording thickened.

The static rose.

The mattress dipped further.

---

At 06:03:55, the breathing of the sleeper changed.

Deep inhale.

A slow, shaky exhale.

As if aware of a presence without waking fully.

The whispered voice — the one approximating mine — shifted from imitation into something closer… more aligned in cadence.

It leaned into the mic.

The proximity effect bloomed across the low end.

A quiet sentence emerged:

“Don’t be frightened. He’s almost you.”

I stopped playback.

Left the room.

Returned after several minutes.

Resumed.

---

At 06:44:31, the tape picked up a new sound:

Footsteps.

Bare feet.

Crossing the room slowly, as if pacing or circling.

The sleeper twitched.

Whimpered.

Then his breath stabilized again.

The footsteps stopped at the mic.

A low exhale moved across it — not breath, but a pressure fluctuation, like someone pressing their face close without drawing air in or out.

A whisper followed, louder than the others:

“Wake up when he arrives. Not before.”

---

The final anomaly occurred at 07:58:02.

The sleeper woke.

Not gradually.

Abruptly.

A sharp inhale, then a long pause — the kind that accompanies shock rather than grogginess.

He whispered a phrase in my voice:

“Where am I?”

The other voice answered, directly into the microphone:

“Here. Where you’ll be again tonight.”

The tape fluttered — a mechanical wobble — but no physical damage was visible.

The last 20 seconds were nearly silent except for two breaths:

One shallow.

One deeper.

Out of sync.

Just before the tape ended, the deeper voice whispered:

“Wake me before I arrive.”

The recording clicked off.

---

I listened to the tape three times.

The breathing patterns match mine exactly.

The sleep murmurs too.

The voice that whispers near the mic overlaps my spectrographic profile by 92% — enough to classify as the same speaker under typical analysis.

Except:

I have never slept in a room with those acoustics.

I have never spoken those sentences.

I have no memory of the hours recorded.

At 11:12, as I finished documenting the anomalies, I checked the hallway camera feed for the Archive’s service entrance.

At 06:12 — two minutes before the package was found — the feed showed a figure placing the box at my door.

Face obscured.

Posture familiar.

Height identical.

Frame was corrupted just as the figure turned toward the camera.

But there was enough detail to see the jacket.

It was mine.

Not my current one.

The one I wore three years ago.
