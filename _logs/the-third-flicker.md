The diner sat between two long stretches of flat highway where the land gave up on trying to grow anything. A narrow rectangle of stainless steel, neon script flickering in daylight, gravel lot empty except for a single sedan.

I arrived at 14:22 following a report filed through the Archive’s referral line. The caller had said only one thing:

> “He’s been here before. He said you’d come.”

No return number. No name.

The sky was colorless and bright. The air carried a dry electrical smell, like ozone after a storm that never arrived.

I approached the front door. The neon sign sputtered once, then steadied as I stepped inside.

---

The diner was mostly empty.

A long counter ran the length of the left wall. Booths lined the right. A back hallway led to the restrooms and a staff area. The lights were on but dim, humming with an uneven frequency that felt more like interference than electricity.

A single man sat in the booth closest to the window. His coat folded beside him. Hands wrapped around a mug he wasn’t drinking from.

He looked up as I entered. His expression was recognition too quickly masked.

The waitress behind the counter—early fifties, gray hair tied back—watched me with mild confusion.

I chose a stool near the center of the counter.

She approached. “Coffee?”

I nodded.

While she poured, she glanced at my ID badge, the one I keep clipped inside my jacket.

“You’re Finch, right?” she asked.

I paused.

“I don’t believe we’ve met.”

She gave a small, impatient laugh. “Not today,” she said, turning away. “But you know that.”

Steam drifted from the coffee between us. The fluorescent bulbs overhead hissed louder, then softer, a breathing pattern.

---

At 14:27, the man in the booth stood.

He walked toward me with careful steps, as if rehearsed. He kept his hands visible, palms slightly open.

“You came back,” he said quietly.

“I’ve never been here before,” I replied.

He smiled—a slow, sympathetic expression reserved for the very confused.

“I get it,” he said. “You don’t want to talk about it again.”

He glanced toward the waitress. She turned away as if she knew her cue.

The man leaned in.

“You sat right over there last time,” he whispered, gesturing to the far stool. “Said you were passing through. Said something was following you. Said we shouldn’t touch the windows.”

I stared at him.

“What did I look like?” I asked.

He seemed confused by the question. “Same as now,” he said. “Same jacket. Same voice. You ordered a coffee. You stayed about eight minutes. Left right before the buzzing started.”

“What buzzing?”

He pointed to the lighting overhead.

As if responding, the fluorescents flickered. A rising hum trembled through the fixtures, then faded.

“That,” he said.

---

At 14:32, I surveyed the diner.

No cameras. The wiring above the counter had an old splice that didn’t match the rest of the conduit—something installed later, hastily, with mismatched screws.

The waitress approached again, holding a small receipt slip.

“Forgot to give you this,” she said.

The slip was blank except for a handwritten note:

> You asked me to remind you. Not long now.

I turned it over. Nothing on the back.

“What is this?” I asked.

She frowned. “You handed it to me when you walked in, hon. Said you’d forget.”

I folded the slip into my jacket pocket.

The man in the booth had returned to his seat. His coffee mug trembled slightly against the table—vibration, not nerves.

The fluorescent hum grew louder for two seconds, then went silent again.

---

At 14:35, I walked to the booth.

“Tell me what I said,” I asked.

The man shook his head. “You don’t want that.”

“I’m asking now.”

He swallowed. “Fine. But don’t make me say it twice.”

He leaned forward.

“You told me something was coming through the interference. Something that had your voice but wasn’t you. You said it always arrives twenty minutes before you do. You said this place was safe until the third flicker.”

I let the silence settle.

“When did the lights flicker today?” I asked.

“Twice so far,” he said.

As if on cue, one of the bulbs near the far end of the diner flickered—a fast double-blink.

“Now three,” he whispered.

---

At 14:37, the air pressure shifted.

A soft pop sounded near the back hallway, as though a door had sealed behind someone. The waitress looked up sharply, then busied herself stacking napkin dispensers.

The man in the booth slid out again, urgency in his movement.

“You should go,” he said.

“I need you to stay where I can talk to you.”

He shook his head fiercely. “You told me not to be here for this part.”

“For what part?”

The lights dimmed, then surged to full brightness. A deep electrical throb passed through the floor.

The man grabbed his coat and backed toward the exit.

“Last time,” he said, voice trembling, “you said it wasn’t a person. You said it was… the space left over. Whatever was between the buzzing.”

He fled the diner.

The bell above the door did not ring when he pushed it open.

---

At 14:39, the waitress approached one final time.

“I’m closing early,” she said softly, without looking at me. “You should settle up.”

“I haven’t ordered anything but coffee.”

She placed a small bill on the counter anyway. A single line was penciled in.

> Check the mirror behind you.

I turned.

The long mirror that ran behind the counter reflected the diner, empty except for me.

But the stool the man had pointed to earlier—the one where I supposedly sat “last time”—was not empty in the reflection.

A figure sat there.

Same jacket as mine.

Same posture.

Head turned slightly away, as if waiting for a cue.

But in the real diner, the stool was empty.

My pulse tightened.

The fluorescents hummed again.

This time they did not fade.

---

At 14:40, the buzzing escalated into a thick, electrical drone that vibrated in my teeth.

In the mirror, the figure rose from the stool.

I turned to look at the real space behind me.

Nothing there.

When I looked back at the mirror, the figure was closer.

Shoulder-height.

Facing me now.

Out of focus, like a double exposure trying to resolve itself.

The drone intensified.

The air around the counter rippled faintly.

I stepped back.

The figure in the mirror stepped forward.

One pace.

Then another.

At the exact pace I moved.

Except—

Its reflection followed a different path than mine. Not mirroring. Advancing.

The humming built into a single piercing frequency.

A bulb shattered.

The mirror vibrated.

The figure reached the near edge of the counter in the reflection.

And then—

It turned its head fully toward me.

The face was mine.

But the mouth was wrong.

It was slightly open, as if mid-sentence, repeating something silently.

Something I had not yet said.

The lights cut out.

The humming ceased instantly.

The mirror went black.
