The request came from the state forensic lab at 08:12.

A technician had flagged a fingerprint match anomaly: 62% identity.

Partial matches are routine. Statistical fuzz. Smudges, distortions, dust.

But the technician emphasized the phrasing:

> “Not a partial print that resembles yours.
> A full print that almost is yours.”

A ridge map that approached my own,

but deviated at consistent, patterned intervals—

as if built from instructions that weren’t fully resolved.

The object it came from was a metal drawer handle in an abandoned vocational school scheduled for demolition.

I arrived at 09:47.

---

At 09:58, I reached the second-floor classroom.

Morning light entered in narrow slants through warped blinds.

Dust rose in faint veils where I stepped.

The drawer in question belonged to a rusting metal desk.

The fingerprint was still visible under oblique lighting—

a perfect whorl, then a section where the ridges hesitated,

as if whoever left it had been unsure how to complete the pattern.

I lifted it but found nothing else unusual.

The room felt hollow in the way neglected buildings do:

no pressure changes, no static in the air, no irregular acoustics.

Normal.

I documented the print and sent a photo to the lab.

Measurement confirmed the anomaly:

62% match to my left index finger.

Not mine.

Not random.

Close.

---

At 10:14, in a science classroom across the hall,

I found a coffee mug with residue on the rim.

The lab later determined the lip print matched my own 47%.

The spacing between impressions was wider than my mouth.

Too wide.

As though someone had the general structure of my face,

but not the exact proportions.

My own mug has micro-scratches at the base from a chipped ceramic counter.

This mug had a nearly identical scratch pattern,

except spaced differently—off by a few millimeters.

Attempts, maybe.

Drafts.

The idea felt absurd, so I wrote it plainly in the notes:

> “Artifacts approximating subject Finch; none exact.
> Pattern indicates progressive refinement.”

I kept moving.

---

At 10:41, I entered an administrative office.

On the desk lay a sheet of paper with writing in my style—

similar slant, similar pressure—

but the letter shapes were subtly wrong.

Loops too round.

Connections between letters too practiced.

It read:

> “Finch—Initial test acceptable. Continue.”

The signature beneath it resembled mine

in the way a practiced imitation resembles an original.

Yet the strokes had confidence my own hand lacks.

I pressed my thumb into the margin.

My own print, clean, unmistakable.

Compared to the imitation version, my real one looked… human. Imperfect.

I folded the page and sealed it in an evidence sleeve.

The air felt denser now.

As though the building exhaled.

---

At 11:06, in a storage room near the stairwell,

I found a pair of gloves on the floor.

Black nitrile.

Common.

Nothing unusual at a glance.

But inside, the lining bore faint salt residue.

Sweat salts.

The lab would later confirm the composition matched mine 89%—

close enough to suggest the same biological profile,

but not an identical sample.

The gloves were unused.

Pristine.

So how did they carry nearly my profile?

I placed them in a bag and kept searching.

The sense of incremental approximation had become impossible to ignore.

---

At 11:28, I found the third artifact.

A notebook.

Identical make and model to the ones I use in the field.

Same manufacturer’s batch.

Inside, the first page contained my handwriting—

my exact handwriting—

but with words I would never choose.

Sentences too ornate.

Punctuation I don’t use.

Observations I hadn’t made.

But in the margins,

lighter indentations showed under oblique light:

Corrections.

Erased drafts.

Attempts.

As though someone had been practicing my tone.

Refining.

The last page was blank except for faint pressure marks,

shallow impressions of words that had never been written fully.

Under magnification, the indentations formed the outline of a sentence:

“Not ready yet.”

I photographed it, closed the notebook, and kept walking.

---

At 11:52, behind the stage curtain of the old auditorium,

I found a maintenance closet with a single metal chair.

On the chair:

A pair of glasses.

Black frame.

Rectangular lenses.

Light wear at the hinges.

A small scuff on the right temple arm.

I recognized them immediately.

They were mine.

Down to the micro-scratches on the left lens,

caused by wiping them with my coat sleeve last winter.

Down to the faint bend in the right arm from when I sat on them by accident.

Down to the specific smudge pattern on the nose pads,

consistent with the shape of my bridge.

My fingerprint residue appeared faintly on the inside of the lens—

a full match when tested.

Except I was wearing my own glasses.

My glasses were on my face.

Warm.

Fogged slightly from my breath.

I lifted the found pair.

They were warm too.

As if recently worn.

The weight distribution matched mine.

The prescription was verified later: identical to mine.

But inside the right temple arm, barely visible,

etched so faintly it required angled light to reveal:

MODEL 1.0 — APPROVED

The inscription was not factory-made.

The letters were cut with precision,

but shallow, hesitant.

As if engraved by someone unsure how deep to go.

Someone practicing.

Someone learning.

The chair beneath the glasses had dust rings,

concentric shapes showing the glasses had been placed there recently,

then lifted, then returned again and again.

Tests.

Iterations.

Attempts.

I looked up.

Nothing moved.

The closet was empty.

But the air had a density to it,

a quiet expectancy,

as though the room were waiting for confirmation.

I placed the glasses back on the chair exactly where they had been.

They fit the dust outline perfectly.

As if designed for that position.

I closed the closet door.

---

At 12:07, as I prepared to leave the building,

my recorder—unused all morning—activated itself.

A brief audio tone.

Then a voice:

My voice.

Speaking a single word:

“Next.”

Playback showed no waveform irregularities.

No distortion.

No electronic interference.

The voice was mine.

Exactly mine.

But I had not spoken.
