The demolition contractor described it as “a person poured into the wall.”

They had been taking down the interior partition between two former office suites when a section of drywall bowed outward and split. Behind it, in the narrow gap between studs, they found a body curled on its side, knees pulled up toward its chest.

No signs of construction error.

No access panel.

No break in the exterior.

Just a human form sealed inside an eight-inch cavity that had no entry point.

I arrived at 10:06. The building—a three-story brick office block slated for conversion to apartments—sat quiet under a low sky. The air in the gutted corridor smelled of plaster dust and old, trapped air.

The body still lay where they’d found it.

Someone had draped a tarp over the opening. When they lifted it, the cold reached me before the sight did.

---

The cavity was just wide enough for a human torso.

Metal studs framed the space. Electrical conduit ran along one side, unbroken, which meant it had been installed with no awareness of the body’s presence.

The corpse was not decomposed.

No bloating, no discoloration, no collapse. The skin was pale, faintly sallow, like someone who had died in their sleep a day or two before.

He wore a dark field coat.

Dark trousers.

Boots.

A laminated badge hung from a lanyard around his neck, pressed awkwardly between his clavicle and the drywall.

The badge bore my name.

Halloway Finch.

Archive clearance codes correct.

Photo correct.

The face attached to the body, however, was not.

Not entirely.

---

From certain angles, the features were mine.

Same scar at the edge of the left eyebrow.

Same crooked bridge from an old break.

Same line at the corner of the mouth.

But the proportions were slightly off. The jaw set narrower. The distance between nose and upper lip a fraction shorter. The expression fixed not in death slackness but in a kind of unresolved effort.

Like someone about to speak and never getting there.

The eyes were closed.

The lids did not look surgically altered, but there was a faint, unnatural smoothness to them, as if they had been pressed shut before the skin had finished deciding how to fold.

I checked the hands.

The right wrist bore the pale band of skin where I wear my watch.

The watch itself was gone.

---

At 10:19, the site forensics team logged their preliminary findings.

No sign of forced entry into the wall cavity. No damage to studs, panels, or conduit prior to the demolition strike. No blood on the interior surfaces. No tool marks. The insulation showed no displacement consistent with someone being pushed through the structure.

The body appeared to have originated inside the wall, rather than having been placed there.

Temperature readings were abnormal.

The air in the cavity was several degrees warmer than the surrounding space.

When they checked skin temperature at the neck, the reading was barely below living baseline.

“He’s still warm,” one of the techs said before catching himself and switching pronouns.

“It. It’s still warm.”

Their eyes flicked between the body and me and then away, as if unsure where to rest.

---

At 10:27, I examined the badge.

The lamination was scuffed at the edges, as if worn for some time.

The ID photo was recent enough to match my current hair length and the faint lines at the corners of my eyes.

The issue date on the lower edge was seven months ahead of today’s date.

Not a misprint.

Not a transposition.

Future.

The barcode, when scanned with a portable reader, returned my personnel file—with an appended field tagged RENEWAL ISSUED and a timestamp that had not yet occurred.

None of that frightened me as much as the worn area at the top where the plastic had rubbed against a shirt collar.

Someone had carried this badge long enough to age it.

---

At 10:33, we extracted the body.

It resisted.

Not the usual friction of tissue against confined space, but a kind of adherence, as if the skin had fused partially to the gypsum and insulation. When they eased it out, fibers clung to the coat sleeves and hair.

No spinal damage consistent with this position was evident. No compression fractures in the ribs. The bones had accommodated the impossible space.

The body was mine down to the small mole on the left shoulder blade.

I confirmed the match silently.

The techs avoided meeting my gaze.

“Do you want to step out, sir?” one of them asked.

“No,” I said. “Continue.”

---

At 10:41, the internal examination began on-site.

The medical examiner—a contracted pathologist with twenty years in the role—reported no signs of trauma. No ligature marks. No petechiae. The fingernails were clean, with no drywall or insulation under them. No evidence of struggle against the confines of the wall.

Lividity was inconsistent.

Places that should have shown pooled blood did not. Places that should have remained pale were dark.

The examiner swore under his breath.

“This doesn’t make sense.”

He checked lung tissue with a portable scanner. The display returned normal structure. No fluid. No congestion.

“Cause of death?” I asked.

“Nothing obvious,” he replied. “If you told me he lay down and went to sleep, I’d believe you. If you told me he stepped into the wall and never came out, I’d say the wall killed him. But I don’t have a word for that.”

He paused, then added, “I don’t like that his face looks more like you from this angle.”

From that angle, it did.

From another, it didn’t.

As if the image were still resolving.

---

At 10:58, I opened the notebook recovered from the body’s inner coat pocket.

Same make as mine.

Same ruled pattern, same clothbound cover.

The first several pages were blank.

Farther in, pages contained field notes in my handwriting—my exact hand, same pressure, same small tendencies in the letters. Dates in the margins ran forward from the present by weeks and months.

Incidents I had not yet investigated were catalogued in terse bullet points. Sites I did not recognize. Conditions I had not yet encountered.

Near the back of the notebook, the entries grew fragmented.

Half sentences.

Coordinates with no labels.

The word correction written three times on one page and underlined until the paper tore.

The final complete entry was dated tomorrow.

It described this building.

This corridor.

This wall.

The last line read:

The cavity is already occupied. It found the wrong one.

There was no period at the end of the sentence.

---

At 11:12, DNA samples were collected.

The lab report would later list them as “inconclusive,” with a note in the margin: significant overlap with subject Finch, H., but not sufficient to establish identity as monozygotic self-match.

An internal memo, not meant for the Archive, summarized informally:

> “If this were a twin nobody knew about, I’d accept it. If you’re asking if it’s him, I don’t want to answer.”

Standing in the gutted corridor, with dust settling around us and the empty wall gaping like a missing tooth, I watched them zip the body into the bag.

From where I stood, the face was no longer mine.

From the corner of my eye, it was.

Both impressions felt equally true.

---

At 11:19, as they wheeled the gurney toward the elevator, the building’s fire alarm chirped once—a single, abortive tone, as if a signal had tried to trigger and thought better of it.

The lights did not flash. No sirens followed.

Just that one dissonant note, hanging in the air.

Later, reviewing the corridor’s construction records, I found the date the wall had been installed.

Ten years ago.

Long before my current assignment. Long before my clearance level.

The time-of-death estimate for the body in the wall, based on tissue condition, was twenty-four to forty-eight hours before discovery.

Not ten years.

Not any number that matched the history of the structure.

When I closed the file, my own badge felt heavy at my collar.

For a moment—a brief, irrational moment—I had the sensation of being inside something, pressed between surfaces, waiting for someone to cut me out.

The walls were smooth.

The corridor was empty.

Behind me, the drywall flexed almost imperceptibly and then was still.
