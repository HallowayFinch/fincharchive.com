The request came from Records, not Field.

An internal audit had flagged a cluster of my old cases with incomplete digital transcriptions. They wanted me to review the original notebooks, fill in missing context, and resolve discrepancies between my written observations and the official incident reports.

I was given a gray archival box labeled in my handwriting:

> FINCH — FIELD LOGS / SERIES 12–17

The date range covered a three-year span I remember clearly.

Assignments I could locate on an internal map of my own life.

The first few notebooks were familiar—creases in the covers where I expected them, entries written in my usual compressed hand. The names of sites rang the expected bells. I could recall the weather, the smell of some of the rooms, the way light fell through certain windows.

The last notebook in the box, however, felt wrong the moment I touched it.

The paper stock was slightly smoother. The elastic band had a faint indentation from a pen having been clipped there for long periods of time.

I do not clip my pen to that part of the notebook.

I opened it anyway.

---

The inside cover bore my name.

> H. Finch
> Field / Archive

The ink was my preferred blue.

The loops and angles matched my muscle memory.

The pressure of the strokes was right.

Beneath my name, in smaller letters:

> Series 12–17 (Revised)

I have never labeled a notebook that way.

My notebooks carry simple date ranges, site sequences, shorthand notations that would not be intelligible to anyone else.

“Revised” implied a previous attempt.

It implied this was not the first version.

---

The first entry was dated in the middle of a month I recognized, during a period when I knew I had been on assignment in a coastal town, cataloging a series of power station anomalies.

The heading read:

> SITE: Larkspur Municipal Records Annex
> Condition: Decommissioned
> Purpose: Secondary review

I have no memory of visiting the Larkspur Records Annex.

Yet the notes that followed were written in my hand,

with my shorthand,

using my preferred structural markers:

“Obs.” for observation

“Rsn.” for reasoning

“Q.” for unanswered questions

The entry described a three-story brick building, windows papered over from inside.

I checked the Archive’s digital index.

There is a Larkspur Municipal Records Annex.

It has been decommissioned for six years.

The case number assigned to it matched the code written in the upper corner of the page.

I do not remember being there.

---

At 09:32, the notes said, I entered through the south door.

> Obs. 01: “Interior air stale, low dust. Alarm panel removed, wiring intact. Fluorescent fixture in lobby flickers at irregular interval, approximate period 7.3s.”

I can read my own observational language the way I might read my own fingerprints.

But when I tried to summon the corresponding mental image of the lobby, my mind produced nothing.

Just the word “lobby” floating in blank space.

Records confirmed that my access card had been scanned at that site on that date at 09:29.

My memory did not.

---

The entry grew more specific.

> Obs. 02: “Second-floor corridor smells of old paper and solvent. Several metal shelving units left in situ, labels removed. North-facing window taped over from inside with brown packing tape—pattern suggests previous removal and reapplication.”

No images.

No smell.

No echo of that space when I tried to reconstruct it.

But the handwriting showed the small, impatient tightening in the descenders that only shows up when I am writing on-site, standing, with my notebook in one hand.

Desk work produces a different pressure.

My own body testified that I had been there.

My mind did not.

---

I flipped ahead.

The next page described a stairwell.

> Obs. 05: “Third-floor landing: fire door propped with cardboard folder. Folder empty. Stamp on inside: LARKSPUR MUN. / DISCARDED / NOT FOR RETENTION.”

That is not how I phrase things when I fabricate examples.

This was not an exercise.

It was a record.

At the bottom of the page:

> Rsn. 01: “Annex used as informal overflow. Discarded materials still partially organized. Nothing anomalous so far.”

The word “so” was underlined.

I would not underline that word without reason.

---

I decided to visit the Annex.

It was 13:11 by then.

The building still stood at the address in the file, though a demolition banner now hung across its facade, warning of upcoming work.

The south door was chained.

I used the side entrance.

Inside, the air was stale.

There was very little dust.

A fluorescent fixture in the lobby flickered at what my internal sense of time immediately wanted to call seven seconds.

I checked my watch.

Seven-point-three, approximately.

I flipped the notebook to the lobby page.

The description matched what I saw now, years later.

All of it.

Down to the pattern of missing tiles in the ceiling grid.

---

On the second floor, the corridor smelled of old paper and solvent.

Metal shelving units stood in uneven rows.

No labels.

The north-facing window was taped over with brown packing tape in the pattern my notes had described: an improvised grid, patches of double-layered tape where someone had torn it off and replaced it in the same spot.

I touched the edge of one strip.

The tape had gone brittle.

My fingers left a faint print in the dust on the mullion.

The notebook in my other hand felt heavier.

---

I reached the third-floor landing at 13:47.

The fire door was propped open with a cardboard folder.

The folder was empty.

The inside stamp read, in blue:

> LARKSPUR MUN. / DISCARDED / NOT FOR RETENTION

The words were not remarkable in themselves.

But the sense that my body was walking through a script written by someone else—someone using my hand—bent the air around me.

I flipped the page.

The next line in the notebook read:

> Obs. 06: “Door to Records Room A sticks on lower hinge; requires increased force to open. Floor inside scattered with unsorted boxes. Table along west wall. Chair. Recorder left on table at 13:52.”

I checked the time.

13:49.

---

I stood in front of the Records Room A door.

The notebook said the door would stick.

It did.

I had to lean my shoulder into it to make it move.

Inside, the floor was scattered with unsorted boxes.

There was a table along the west wall.

A chair.

No recorder on the table yet.

Not at 13:51.

I waited.

I did not place my recorder on the table.

I watched the empty tabletop.

Nothing appeared.

The notebook description was correct up to the point where it predicted an action I had not yet taken.

My hand, years ago, had assumed I would follow my habits.

Place recorder.

Begin dictated observations.

I kept the recorder in my pocket.

---

I sat in the chair.

The notebook’s next line:

> Obs. 07: “Ambient noise minimal. Building aches occasionally. Chair slightly unsteady on back right leg—note wobble.”

I rocked back.

The back right leg wobbled.

---

Farther down the page, the entry changed.

The sentences became less observational, more directive.

Not written to the Archive.

Written to someone else.

> “Remember: you always sit here first. That’s why the leg feels wrong. Check the underside.”

I lifted the chair.

A small sticker clung to the underside of the seat, half peeled.

It bore my name.

> FINCH — A

I do not mark furniture.

I do not assign myself letters.

The glue had dried long ago.

It had been there for years.

---

The next page no longer used “Obs.” or “Rsn.” prefixes.

It broke from my standard format.

It read:

> “You missed this part last time. Don’t leave the recorder. Don’t go to the roof. Check the back of the shelving in Records Room B instead.”

I flashed back through memory, searching for any trace of a previous visit, any recollection of a roof, a recorder left running, a feeling of unfinished business.

Nothing surfaced.

But my access card logs had recorded two separate dates for entry to this building.

The one attached to the notebook entry.

And one two weeks later, with no corresponding record in the digital reports.

The Archive contained no roof photographs.

No roof notes.

Whatever happened there, if anything, had not made it into the official record.

---

I turned the page.

The handwriting shifted subtly.

Same basic structure.

Same letters.

But the lines were straighter.

The pressure more controlled.

As though whoever was writing had practiced being me.

> “This version didn’t reach the roof. Good. Don’t force it. Go to Records B. You’ll try to remember doing this before. You won’t be able to. That’s expected.”

The ink on that line had feathered slightly, suggesting humidity.

Not today’s.

Years ago.

I stayed in the chair until my heartbeat slowed.

Then I went to Records Room B.

---

The door stuck in the same way as the other.

The notebook had not mentioned that.

Inside, rows of shelving units stood draped in sheets of plastic.

On one unit, at shoulder height, a narrow vertical gap showed where two metal uprights met.

The notes said:

> “Here. Behind this. You won’t remember leaving it. You did.”

I slid my fingers into the gap.

My fingertips touched something smooth and cold.

I pulled it free.

A small, hardbound memo book.

Same make as my field notebooks.

Same brand.

On the front cover, in my hand:

> H. Finch — Larkspur / First Pass

First.

Not series.

Not range.

First.

I opened it.

The pages were blank for the first few leaves.

Then, faintly, under the right angle of light, I saw indentations—

pressure from writing that had once existed there,

hard enough to deform the fibers,

erased afterward.

Under magnification, the impressions resolved into legible strokes.

My strokes.

But the words were not in the notebook anymore.

They had been removed.

The remaining indentations read:

> “Roof access unsafe. Do not let him follow you up there again.”

And lower down:

> “He forgets this every time.”

---

The current notebook’s final page contained only one line, centered:

> “These notes are not for you.”

Beneath it, smaller:

> “If you can read this, you’re not the version who needed them.”

The rest of the page was empty.

My pen hovered there for a long time.

I did not write anything.

---

Back in the Records office, the audit team asked if I could resolve the discrepancies.

“Mostly transcription errors,” I said. “Some missing context.”

I did not mention the second memo book.

It sat in my bag, weightless and heavy at once.

That night, I spread my notebooks across my table at home.

Series 1 through 17.

Early cases.

Later ones.

In several of them, on back pages, I began to notice faint indentations under the right light.

Not words.

Not yet.

Just the suggestion of letters pressed hard enough to leave a trace, then erased.

As though someone had written to me

and then changed their mind about whether this version was the right recipient.

I closed the covers one by one until the table was clear.

The current notebook lay open where I had left it, lines ready for the next case.

At the top of the page, without meaning to, I wrote:

> “For the one who comes after this.”

The handwriting was mine.

The intention was not.

I capped the pen and did not write anything further.
