# About the Finch Archive

The Finch Archive collects recovered notes from incomplete transmissions.

This project preserves the fragments, with minimal intervention, and presents them in a consistent, navigable form.

**Transmission lookup**  
Certain materials are not listed in the public catalog. When a log or artifact references an access key, it can be submitted through the [Transmission Lookup](/t/) interface. The archive will return any records it is willing to acknowledge.
