The Finch Archive collects recovered notes, incomplete transmissions, and fragments of observation attributed to **Halloway Finch**.

Each entry appears as it was found&mdash;unaltered, unverified, and incomplete. No official record confirms the origin or intent of these materials. Patterns emerge only to collapse. Dates repeat. Some transmissions reference events that have not yet occurred.

This project preserves those fragments with minimal intervention and presents them in a consistent, navigable form.

## Relationship to other records

The Finch Archive at **fincharchive.com** serves as the canonical index: logs, field notes, and referenced artifacts are cataloged here with stable IDs and checksums.

Related materials and release notes are also published through the Substack instance at  
[`hallowayfinch.com`](https://www.hallowayfinch.com), which functions as a public broadcast channel. When the two sources differ, the Archive is treated as the authoritative record.

## Transmission lookup

Certain materials are not listed in the public catalog.

When a log or artifact references an access key, it can be submitted through the  
[Transmission Lookup](/t/) interface. The Archive will return any records it is willing to acknowledge.

Responses may change over time. Readers are advised to record what they can.
