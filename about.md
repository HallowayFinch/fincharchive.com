<p>
  The Finch Archive collects recovered notes, incomplete transmissions, and fragments of
  observation attributed to <strong>Halloway Finch</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Each entry appears as it was found -- unaltered, unverified, and incomplete. No official record
  confirms the origin or intent of these materials. Patterns emerge only to collapse. Dates repeat.
  Some transmissions reference events that have not yet occurred.
</p>

<p>
  This project preserves those fragments with minimal intervention and presents them in a
  consistent, navigable form.
</p>

## Relationship to other records

<p>
  The Finch Archive at <a href="https://fincharchive.com">fincharchive.com</a> serves as the
  canonical index: logs, field notes, and referenced artifacts are cataloged here with stable
  identifiers and checksums.
</p>

<p>
  Related materials and release notes are also published through 
  <a href="https://www.hallowayfinch.com" rel="noopener">HallowayFinch.com</a>, which may
  contain drafts, alternate presentations, or out-of-sequence fragments.
</p>

<p>
  When discrepancies appear between sources, the Finch Archive record is considered primary unless
  explicitly marked otherwise.
</p>

## Transmission lookup

<p>
  Certain materials are not listed in the public catalog. When a log or artifact references an
  access key, it can be submitted through the
  <a href="/t/">Transmission Lookup</a> interface. The archive will return any records it is willing
  to acknowledge.
</p>

<p>
  A lack of response does not guarantee the absence of a record. It may indicate redaction,
  misclassification, or an ongoing review.
