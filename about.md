The Finch Archive collects recovered notes from incomplete transmissions.

This project preserves the fragments with minimal intervention and presents them in a consistent, navigable form.

## Transmission lookup

Certain materials are not listed in the public catalog.

When a log or artifact references an access key, it can be submitted through the
[Transmission Lookup](/t/) interface. The archive will return any records it is willing to acknowledge.
