The Finch Archive collects recovered notes, incomplete transmissions, and fragments of
observation attributed to **Halloway Finch**.

Each entry appears as it was found—unaltered, unverified, and incomplete. No official
record confirms the origin or intent of these materials. Patterns emerge only to collapse.
Dates repeat. Some transmissions reference events that have not yet occurred.

This project preserves those fragments with minimal intervention and presents them in a
consistent, navigable form.

## Relationship to other records

The Finch Archive at [FinchArchive.com](https://fincharchive.com) serves as the canonical
index: logs, field notes, and referenced artifacts are cataloged here with stable
identifiers and checksums.

Related materials and release notes are also published through Substack at
[HallowayFinch.com](https://www.hallowayfinch.com), which may contain drafts, alternate
presentations, or out-of-sequence fragments.

When discrepancies appear between sources, the Finch Archive record is considered primary
unless explicitly marked otherwise.

## Transmission lookup

Certain materials are not listed in the public catalog. When a log or artifact references
an access key, it can be submitted through the
[Transmission Lookup](/t/) interface. The archive will return any records it is willing
to acknowledge.

A lack of response does not guarantee the absence of a record. It may indicate redaction,
misclassification, or an ongoing review.
